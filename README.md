# Machine Translation: English to Kashmiri
## Introduction
Machine translation (MT) plays a crucial role in breaking language barriers and facilitating seamless communication. This project focuses on developing an English to Kashmiri translation system using AI4Bharat's IndicTrans2-en-indic-1B model. Our goal is to create an efficient, accurate, and scalable translation model that can be used for educational, research, and communication purposes.

By leveraging deep learning and natural language processing (NLP), this project aims to bridge the gap between English and Kashmiri speakers, ensuring better accessibility to digital content in Kashmiri.

⚠ Note: Running this model requires high computational power. It is recommended to use Google Colab for execution. Run on **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**
## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Develop an AI-powered translation system for converting English text into Kashmiri while preserving meaning and context.

2. Enhance the translation quality by implementing preprocessing and postprocessing techniques for better linguistic accuracy.

3. Optimize the model for efficiency using quantization techniques (4-bit and 8-bit) to support lower-memory devices.

4. Ensure script accuracy by handling Kashmiri script-specific nuances effectively.

5. Improve entity recognition and formatting to maintain proper names, dates, and technical terms in translations.

6. Deploy and integrate the model into applications such as chatbots, websites, or research tools.

## Toolkit Overview
The project utilizes a combination of machine learning frameworks, NLP libraries, and pre-trained models. Below is an overview of the tools used:

### 1. Model and Frameworks
IndicTrans2 – A multilingual translation model optimized for Indian languages.

Hugging Face Transformers – Provides the core implementation for loading and using the translation model.

Torch (PyTorch) – Used for deep learning model execution.

### 2. NLP Libraries
SentencePiece – Tokenization and subword processing.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) – Sentence segmentation and additional text preprocessing.

MosesTokenizer – Tokenization for better linguistic structuring.

### 3. Optimization Tools
BitsAndBytes (bnb) – Enables 4-bit and 8-bit quantization for efficient model inference.

Accelerate – Optimizes inference performance on GPUs.

Datasets (Hugging Face) – Provides large-scale dataset handling for model training and fine-tuning.

### 4. Custom Processing Modules
IndicTransToolkit – Handles preprocessing (tokenization, entity recognition) and postprocessing (detokenization, formatting) to improve translation quality.
